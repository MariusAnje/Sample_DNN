# **Sample_DNN**  

Sampling Deep Neural Networks to fixed point in **Pytorch**

1. Xor
    * Xor_Sample(Cuda).ipynb: fixed-point implementation of a Xor function in NN
    * Test_int.ipynb: several tests on using only int operations for Xor function
2. CIFAR
    * Working on different accurcies including 8 bits and 16 bits and various differnt networks
